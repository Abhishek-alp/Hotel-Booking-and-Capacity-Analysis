## Hotel Booking and Capacity Analysis :

* **Project objective:**
  **1.** Clean, transform, and merge raw hotel booking (`bookings_data.csv`) and capacity (`rooms_data.csv`) datasets.
  **2.** Create an analysis-ready dataset to calculate KPIs like occupancy percentage (`occ%`) and availability status.
  **3.** Derive actionable insights to evaluate hotel performance and booking trends.

* **Purpose of analysis:** Enable hotels to monitor occupancy, optimize inventory, and support revenue/operations planning with data-driven insights.

* **Importance of analyzing hotel booking data:** Helps identify booking patterns, occupancy gaps, and opportunities to improve demand management.

* **Role of reports:**

  * Track top-performing vs underperforming properties.
  * Detect properties frequently marked as “sold out.”
  * Provide management with reliable metrics for pricing, promotions, and capacity planning.
